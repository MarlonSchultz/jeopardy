# Jeopardy in PHP

This is a simple implementation of the game "Jeopardy".
It relies on PHP 7 and SQLite3.

# Install

Clone repository, run composer install.

# Adding own questions

In Var/Data is an example.db. Use it for scaffolding.
The database to which the game connects can be set in config/parameters.yml

# Roadmap (?)

There is no such thing. This is for fun.
If you want to add features, either fork and PR, or fork and do whatever you want.
